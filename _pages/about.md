I'm a second-year PhD student at MIT CSAIL in [Dr. Polina Golland](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/polina-golland)'s Medical Vision Group. I have been supported by the MIT-Takeda Program and the Abdul Latif Jameel Fellowships. My current research uses equivariant neural networks to track fetal brain motion in MRI, with the aim of enabling a fully auto-navigated imaging system that mitigates motion artifacts in fetal neuroimaging. More broadly, I am interested in modeling and leveraging symmetries in medical imaging data to make learning more efficient.

I obtained my bachelors degree in computer science from the University of Pennsylvania, during which I worked with [Dr. Brian Litt](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g324/p6213) at the [Center for Neuroengineering and Therapeutics](https://cnt.upenn.edu/) and Drs. [Spyros Bakas](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/sbakas/) and [Despina Kontos](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8123294) at the [Center for Biomedical Image Computing & Analytics](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/) on deep learning solutions to automating 3D lesion segmentation in postsurgical epilepsy MRI and quantitative breast density estimation in mammography, respectively. I also received my masters degree in data science from Penn, where I completed my thesis on deploying graph neural networks for distributed control of multi-robot systems under the supervision of [Dr. Alejandro Ribeiro](https://alelab.seas.upenn.edu/). Additionally, I was fortunate enough to intern at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, where I researched neural networks for solving forward and inverse physics problems in the radar domain.

Outside of work, I enjoy staying active, spending time outdoors, traveling, and reading :)
