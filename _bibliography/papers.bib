abstract = {Accurate segmentation of surgical resection sites is critical for clinical assessments and neuroimaging research applications, including resection extent determination, predictive modeling of surgery outcome, and masking image processing near resection sites. In this study, an automated resection cavity segmentation algorithm is developed for analyzing postoperative MRI of epilepsy patients and deployed in an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) that estimates remnant brain volumes, including postsurgical hippocampal remnant tissue. This retrospective study included postoperative T1-weighted MRI from 62 temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients who underwent resective surgery. The resection site was manually segmented and reviewed by a neuroradiologist (JMS). A majority vote ensemble algorithm was used to segment surgical resections, using 3 U-Net convolutional neural networks trained on axial, coronal, and sagittal slices, respectively. The algorithm was trained using 5-fold cross validation, with data partitioned into training (N = 27) testing (N = 9), and validation (N = 9) sets, and evaluated on a separate held-out test set (N = 17). Algorithm performance was assessed using Dice-Sørensen coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance, and volume estimates. Additionally, we deploy a fully-automated, GUI-based pipeline that compares resection segmentations with preoperative imaging and reports estimates of resected brain structures. The cross-validation and held-out test median DSCs were 0.84 ± 0.08 and 0.74 ± 0.22 (median ± interquartile range) respectively, which approach inter-rater reliability between radiologists (0.84–0.86) as reported in the literature. Median 95\% Hausdorff distances were 3.6 mm and 4.0 mm respectively, indicating high segmentation boundary confidence. Automated and manual resection volume estimates were highly correlated for both cross-validation (r = 0.94, p < 0.0001) and held-out test subjects (r = 0.87, p < 0.0001). Automated and manual segmentations overlapped in all 62 subjects, indicating a low false negative rate. In control subjects (N = 40), the classifier segmented no voxels (N = 33), <50 voxels (N = 5), or a small volumes<0.5 cm3 (N = 2), indicating a low false positive rate that can be controlled via thresholding. There was strong agreement between postoperative hippocampal remnant volumes determined using automated and manual resection segmentations (r = 0.90, p < 0.0001, mean absolute error = 6.3 %), indicating that automated resection segmentations can permit quantification of postoperative brain volumes after epilepsy surgery. Applications include quantification of postoperative remnant brain volumes, correction of deformable registration, and localization of removed brain regions for network modeling.}

    abstract = {Seizure frequency and seizure freedom are among the most important outcome measures for patients with epilepsy. In this study, we aimed to automatically extract this clinical information from unstructured text in clinical notes. If successful, this could improve clinical decision-making in epilepsy patients and allow for rapid, large-scale retrospective research.We developed a finetuning pipeline for pretrained neural models to classify patients as being seizure-free and to extract text containing their seizure frequency and date of last seizure from clinical notes. We annotated 1000 notes for use as training and testing data and determined how well 3 pretrained neural models, BERT, RoBERTa, and Bio\_ClinicalBERT, could identify and extract the desired information after finetuning.The finetuned models (BERTFT, Bio\_ClinicalBERTFT, and RoBERTaFT) achieved near-human performance when classifying patients as seizure free, with BERTFT and Bio\_ClinicalBERTFT achieving accuracy scores over 80\\%. All 3 models also achieved human performance when extracting seizure frequency and date of last seizure, with overall F1 scores over 0.80. The best combination of models was Bio\_ClinicalBERTFT for classification, and RoBERTaFT for text extraction. Most of the gains in performance due to finetuning required roughly 70 annotated notes.Our novel machine reading approach to extracting important clinical outcomes performed at or near human performance on several tasks. This approach opens new possibilities to support clinical practice and conduct large-scale retrospective clinical research. Future studies can use our finetuning pipeline with minimal training annotations to answer new clinical questions.},
