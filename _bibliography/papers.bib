  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

abstract = {Accurate segmentation of surgical resection sites is critical for clinical assessments and neuroimaging research applications, including resection extent determination, predictive modeling of surgery outcome, and masking image processing near resection sites. In this study, an automated resection cavity segmentation algorithm is developed for analyzing postoperative MRI of epilepsy patients and deployed in an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) that estimates remnant brain volumes, including postsurgical hippocampal remnant tissue. This retrospective study included postoperative T1-weighted MRI from 62 temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients who underwent resective surgery. The resection site was manually segmented and reviewed by a neuroradiologist (JMS). A majority vote ensemble algorithm was used to segment surgical resections, using 3 U-Net convolutional neural networks trained on axial, coronal, and sagittal slices, respectively. The algorithm was trained using 5-fold cross validation, with data partitioned into training (N = 27) testing (N = 9), and validation (N = 9) sets, and evaluated on a separate held-out test set (N = 17). Algorithm performance was assessed using Dice-Sørensen coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance, and volume estimates. Additionally, we deploy a fully-automated, GUI-based pipeline that compares resection segmentations with preoperative imaging and reports estimates of resected brain structures. The cross-validation and held-out test median DSCs were 0.84 ± 0.08 and 0.74 ± 0.22 (median ± interquartile range) respectively, which approach inter-rater reliability between radiologists (0.84–0.86) as reported in the literature. Median 95 % Hausdorff distances were 3.6 mm and 4.0 mm respectively, indicating high segmentation boundary confidence. Automated and manual resection volume estimates were highly correlated for both cross-validation (r = 0.94, p < 0.0001) and held-out test subjects (r = 0.87, p < 0.0001). Automated and manual segmentations overlapped in all 62 subjects, indicating a low false negative rate. In control subjects (N = 40), the classifier segmented no voxels (N = 33), <50 voxels (N = 5), or a small volumes<0.5 cm3 (N = 2), indicating a low false positive rate that can be controlled via thresholding. There was strong agreement between postoperative hippocampal remnant volumes determined using automated and manual resection segmentations (r = 0.90, p < 0.0001, mean absolute error = 6.3 %), indicating that automated resection segmentations can permit quantification of postoperative brain volumes after epilepsy surgery. Applications include quantification of postoperative remnant brain volumes, correction of deformable registration, and localization of removed brain regions for network modeling.}
